##  Installation Guide (For Non-Developers)

## Option 1 (executable file)

Follow these simple steps to use AnimaEcho without any coding.

* **Download and extract the ZIP file.**
* Navigate to the `run/` Folder
* Run the Plugin

#### Windows
* Double-click on the `AnimaEcho.exe` file inside the `run/Windows` folder.

#### macOS/Linux
* Double-click on the `AnimaEcho` file inside the `run/macOS_Linux` folder, or open the terminal, navigate to the `run/` folder, and run:
    ```bash
    ./AnimaEcho
    ```

üéôÔ∏è The plugin will start recording audio, send it to the AnimaEcho API, and play back the response in sync with your VTube Studio avatar.

## Option 2 (Automatic Virtual Environment)
Install the plugin without conflicts in the system, create an automatic installation script with a virtual environment.

### Windows
* Double-click on `install_animaecho.bat` file inside `run/Windows` folder.

### macOS/Linux

* Navigate to the folder where the script is saved and run the script.

```bash
cd run/macOS_Linux
chmod +x install_animaecho.sh
./install_animaecho.sh
```

* The script created a virtual environment `(animaecho_env)`, activate it before running AnimaEcho

```bash
source animaecho_env/bin/activate
```

* Run the command below within the virtual environment

```bash
animaecho
```

This will create the virtual environment, automatically activate and install AnimaEcho.

* To exit the Python virtual environment, run the command:

```bash
deactivate
```

### Requirements
* VTube Studio must be running with the WebSocket API enabled.
* Grant permission to the plugin when prompted in VTube Studio.
