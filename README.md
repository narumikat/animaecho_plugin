- Ensure that the `python3` command is available in your terminal.
- **Pip:** The package manager **pip** is also required to install the dependencies listed in the requirements.txt file and the plugin.

If you do not have Python installed, consider using **Option 1 (Executable File)**, which does not require Python.

### Windows
* Double-click on `install_animaecho.bat` file inside `run/Windows` folder.

### macOS/Linux

1. Navigate to the folder where the script is saved and run the script.

```bash
cd run/macOS_Linux
chmod +x install_animaecho.sh
./install_animaecho.sh
```

2. The script create a virtual environment `(animaecho_env)`, activate it before running AnimaEcho

```bash
source animaecho_env/bin/activate
```

3. Run the command below within the virtual environment

```bash
animaecho
```
* Each time you want to send audio to VTube Studio, you need to run the `animaecho` command.
* The plugin will:
  - Start recording audio for **5 seconds.**
  - Send the recorded audio to the **AnimaEcho API.**
  - Play back the AI-generated response and synchronize it with your VTube Studio avatar.

4. Follow the instructions in the terminal:
    - The terminal will display instructions and feedback as the plugin runs.
    - Ensure VTube Studio is running with the **WebSocket API enabled**, and grant permissions when prompted.
